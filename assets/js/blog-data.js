            <p class="lead">Spotify didn't just digitize music; it revolutionized how we discover and consume it. The key to its dominance lies in a meticulously crafted user experience.</p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Seamless Personalization</h3>

            <p class="lead">Continuous Design isn't just about iterating quickly; it's a philosophy that integrates user feedback and data into every stage of development, not just at the end.</p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Why Continuous Matters</h3>
            <p>In a fast-changing digital landscape, products must evolve constantly. Continuous Design minimizes the risk of building features users don't need by validating ideas early and often through smaller, iterative releases.</p>
            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Key Strategies for Implementation</h3>
            <p>Strategies include adopting A/B testing as a core discipline, maintaining a living design system, and establishing a tight feedback loop between designers, developers, and customers.</p>
